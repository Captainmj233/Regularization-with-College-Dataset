# Regularization
Conducting regularization method for models to describe relationships among variables to make useful predictions

College dataset downloaded from Kaggle was used to build regualrization models using Ridge and Lasso



After building regularization by using the Ridge and Lasso, Comparison was made to determine which model performed better on the college dataset.
